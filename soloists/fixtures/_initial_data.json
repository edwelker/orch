Life was tough, sho\u2019nuff, but Stan certainly saw and heard enough to fill a jazz and blues singer's repertoire for life. He acquired an early ear for the great crooners and performers of the day like Roy Hamilton, Harry Belafonte and Johnny Mathis. The words were one thing, but Stan\u2019s instincts were drawn to the arrangements that supported the melodies, and gave the music passion... feeling.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>In 1975, Stan moved to Northern California\u2019s Bay area and teamed with Harvey Scales as a sometimes chauffeur and developing songwriter at Super Disc Productions. While there, he composed \u201cAtlantic City: That Big-Time Town\u201d with Harvey, and later recorded it with legendary bandleader Frank Foster. Shortly thereafter, Stan signed on as a staff writer with April Blackwood Music, a subsidiary of CBS Records.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Stan returned to New Jersey in 1980 and began working on his college degrees. In the meantime, he hooked up with super-pianist Michael Renzi at Cafe Carlyle in Manhattan while Renzi was sitting in for Bobby Short with Sylvia Syms. Mike invited him out to see Mel Torme, and before the night was over, Stan was rubbing elbows with pianist George Shearing and Ron O\u2019Connell and his orchestra. As their relationship grew, Stan began compiling demos with Renzi. Along the way, Stan performed with some of New York\u2019s most accomplished jazzmen, including a swinging performance at Newark\u2019s Gateway Hotel with Tony Monte, Frank Wess, Jack Jennings and bandleader Tony Corbicello.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>While at Essex County Community College (1980-1983) Stan worked with Professor Romolo Ferris\u2019 Jazz Workshop developing his songwriting and music notation skills. Between 1983 and 1986 Stan worked regularly with local big bands, including the John Glock Orchestra, Joe Carson\u2019s big band and the Rod Ruth Orchestra. The crowning achievement of this period was a featured performance with Frank Foster and his Loud Minority, during the Billy Taylor Jazz Mobile at Grant\u2019s Tomb, in Manhattan.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>With his formal education concluded, Stan hooked up with the Chink Wing jazz group in Newark, working as the male vocalist alongside Ann Bailey. There was work at the famous Hit Factory, commercial jingles, and still more club gigs keeping Stan busy.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>In 1995, Stan packed up his wife of 34 years (and counting), their daughter Penny and son Stan, Jr., and moved to Howard County, Maryland, where they live today. He works regularly with The Whit Williams \u201cNow\u2019s The Time\u201d big band, the Chuck Funn Orchestra and the Jimmy Wells quartet and has headlined recently with the Howard Burns Orchestra at Frederick (MD) Community College.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>In 2003, Stan founded the Colonnade Of Music record label.

This is her second appearance with the Columbia Orchestra.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the summer of 2005, Ms. Hong made an American premiere recording of Johann Sebastian Bach\u2019s newly discovered aria, \"Alles mit Gott und nichts ohn\u2019 ihn,\" BWV 1127, for National Public Radio\u2019s <em>Performance Today</em> with harpsichordist Joseph Gascho, director of Harmonious Blacksmith.  This recording has been broadcast throughout the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the fall of 2007, Ms. Hong made her debut with Opera Lafayette (Washington, DC) in Rebel and Francoeur\u2019s <em>Z\u00e9lindor, Roi des Sylphes,</em> which included a world premiere recording released in October 2009 through Naxos.  Since then she has also performed the role of La Musique in Charpentier\u2019s <em>Les Arts Florissants</em> at the Kennedy Center.  With Opera Vivente (Baltimore), she has performed the title role in Monteverdi\u2019s <em>Coronation of Poppea,</em> Morgana in Handel\u2019s <em>Alcina,</em> Gilda in Verdi's <em>Rigoletto,</em> Asteria in Handel's <em>Tamburlaine,</em> and Minerva in Monteverdi\u2019s <em>Return of Ulysses.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <em>Baltimore Sun</em> acclaimed her \u201ca triumph as the subtly conniving Poppea. The soprano\u2019s tonal gleam filled the hall beautifully, and her phrasing was always richly detailed. Her acting, too, proved appealing.\u201d  IONARTS described her performance as Morgana having  \u201cthe most persuasive singing by merging musical wit with strong acting and facial expressions, all while showcasing superbly clear text and vocal agility.\u201d  In England, she was Papagena in <em>Die Zauberfl\u00f6te</em> under the direction of Benjamin Luxon, Fortuna and Minerva in Monteverdi\u2019s <em>Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria</em> under the musical direction of Michael Chance and director Tim Carroll for the Snape Proms and Shakespeare's Globe Theatre.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms. Hong received her Bachelor\u2019s and Master\u2019s of Music degrees from the Peabody Conservatory of Music where she studied with Ruth Drucker and Mark Markham.  She was honored to have studied German Lieder and French m\u00e9lodie with Elly Ameling and oratorio with Kurt Equiluz at the Britten-Pears Programme in England.
