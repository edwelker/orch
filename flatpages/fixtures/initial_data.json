He was born in Hartford, Connecticut in 1931. After graduating from Harvard College and Tufts Medical School, he remained in Boston for four years of postgraduate radiology training. He returned to Hartford and practiced radiology until his retirement in 1986.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  Through most of his life, Hurwit had been casually involved with music and composing in an unstructured manner. Since 1986 he has dedicated all of his energies to composing music. He has had no formal training, but has received informal mentoring form Robert Carl, Chairman of the Composition Department of the Hartt School of Music at the University of Hartford, and Michael Lankester, the former Music Director of the Hartford Symphony Orchestra.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  In 1997 the Adaskin String Trio performed Hurwit&rsquo;s &ldquo;Adagio&rdquo; at the University of Hartford. It was then expanded into an &ldquo;Adagio for Orchestra,&rdquo; which was performed later that year by the Hartford Symphony Orchestra with Michael Lankester conducting at the Bushnell Center for Performing Arts.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  After three more years of self instruction, experimentation and musical exploration Hurwit began to compose a symphony. He completed the composition of Symphony No. 1 &ldquo;Remembrance&rdquo; in 2002.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  On November 8, 9 and 10, 2002, Movement III of the symphony (electronic rendition) was choreographed by Peggy Lyman and performed by the Hartt School of Music Dancers at the Lincoln Theater of the University of Hartford.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  On February 13 and 14, 2003, the third movement of this symphony was performed in a concert world premiere by the Hartford Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Edward Cumming at the Bushnell Center for Performing Arts.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  In July of 2004, the symphony was recorded by the Bulgarian National Radio Symphony Orchestra with Michael Lankester conducting. Hurwit spent eight days in Sofia and participated in the rehearsing, revisions, recording, mixing and finalizing process of the CD production. The CD of the symphony was released by MSR Classics in March of 2005, and it is being distributed by Albany Records.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  The West Hartford Symphony Orchestra under the baton of Richard Chiarappa presented world premiere concert performance of the entire Symphony No.1 &ldquo;Remembrance&rdquo; on March 5, 2006.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  <br />\r\n  <strong>The Results of Previous Competitions</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  <strong>2007</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"c1\">\r\n  <p>\r\n    <strong>Winner:</strong> David Heuser: A Screaming Comes Across the Sky\r\n  </p>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <strong>Finalists:</strong>\r\n  </p>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>Randolph Partain: Blood Rite\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>David Sartor: Concerto for Orchestra\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Arthur Gottschalk: Amelia\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Laurence Bitensky: A Perfect Rest\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Mark Lortz: Deus Ex Machina\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Anthony Iannaccone: The Colors of Dream\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Kevin Walczyk: Capriccio\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Takuma Itoh: Concerto for Orchestra\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Lee Actor: Variations and Fugue\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n  <strong>2005</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"c1\">\r\n  <p>\r\n    <strong>Winner:</strong> David Dzubay: Shadow Dance\r\n  </p>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <strong>Finalists:</strong>\r\n  </p>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>Lee Actor: Prelude to a Tragedy\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Arthur Gottschalk: Amelia\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Anthony Iannaccone: The Colors of Dream\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Rob Smith: Push\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Antonio Carlos DeFeo: What's That I Hear?\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Charles Bestor: Variations for Orchestra\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Joshua Penman: Songs the Plants Taught Us\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Ernst Bacon: Smokey Mountain Scherzo\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n  <strong>2003</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"c1\">\r\n  <p>\r\n    <strong>Winner:</strong> Thomas Shnauber: Indigo Street\r\n  </p>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <strong>Finalists:</strong>\r\n  </p>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>Yuanlin Chen: Overture - Rhapsody\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Paul Richards: Trip Hammer\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Stephan Prock: Garden Varieties\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Cynthia Miller: Frequent Flier\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Jeff Manookian: NEXUS\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Erich Stern: Escape\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Allen Menton: Shape-Note Fantasy\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Daniel Powers: The Starry Messenger\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>James Ra: Awakened Spirit\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Christopher Pierce: Aquarelle\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Garrett Byrnes: The Flames of Imbolc\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n</div>",

Yong Ku Ahn became the group's first Music Director and conductor in 1978.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  <img src=\"/images/Orch-88.jpg\" align=\"right\" vspace=\"10\" hspace=\"10\" /> Upon Ahn's retirement in 1988, Carl Dietrich took over leadership of the orchestra. During his tenure, the membership was expanded to include winds and percussion, standard symphonic literature was programmed, and the orchestra dropped \"chamber\" from its name.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  <img src=\"/images/Orch-9798.jpg\" align=\"right\" vspace=\"10\" hspace=\"10\" /> Catherine Ferguson served as the Columbia Orchestra's third Music Director from 1990 until 1999, expanding the repertoire, restructuring the annual Young Artist Competition, establishing a regular season at Howard Community College's Smith Theatre, and leading the Columbia Orchestra's first appearance at the Columbia Festival of the Arts.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  <img src=\"/images/Orch-04.jpg\" align=\"right\" vspace=\"10\" hspace=\"10\" /> Current Music Director Jason Love took the podium in 1999, quickly winning the hearts of orchestra members and audience alike with his humor, generosity, and consummate musicianship. Under his baton, <em>The Baltimore Sun</em> named the Columbia Orchestra \"Howard County's premier ensemble for instrumental music.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  In August 2000, the orchestra hired Tedd Griepentrog as its first Executive Director. During the 2001-2002 season, all Masterworks programs were moved to the Jim Rouse Theatre to accommodate the expanded size of the orchestra and its growing audience. The Young People's Concert added a Musical Instrument Petting Zoo for children of all ages to see, hear, touch, and play orchestral instruments. In June 2002, the orchestra made its Kennedy Center debut in collaboration with the Tony Powell/Music & Movement dance ensemble. During its silver anniversary season, the Columbia Orchestra performed for the Maryland Music Educators Conference at the Baltimore Convention Center and announced its first biannual American Composer Competition.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2005, the organization established an administrative office at the Howard County Center for the Arts and released its first commercial recording, <i>Flying Home: A Tribute to John Denver</i>, performing with members and songwriters of the original John Denver Band.  In June 2007, the orchestra joined renown fiddler and concert artist Mark O\u2019Connor in a concert performed as part of the Columbia Festival of the Arts.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Celebrating it\u2019s 30th Anniversary season, in 2008 the orchestra undertook a community arts project entitled \u201cEmbracing the Millions,\u201d which enlisted members of the community area performing artists in exploring the questions raised by the world\u2019s most famous symphony, Beethoven\u2019s monumental <i>Symphony No. 9</i>.  The project culminated in the orchestra\u2019s performance of the symphony with local choral groups in April 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Now in its fourth decade, the orchestra continues its annual Young Artist Competition and its biannual American Composer Competition.  It has established a free chamber music series featuring members of the orchestra.  Popular pre-concert discussions, conducted by Howard Community College\u2019s William Scanlan Murphy and now sponsored by Baltimore/Washington Financial Advisors, routinely draw up to 20% of the evening\u2019s concert audience.  And the orchestra continues to perform not only the masterworks of the classical repertoire but also works by today\u2019s new generation of composers, including Tan Dun, Osvaldo Goliov, Joan Tower, and Jonathan Leshnoff.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>As it enters its 33rd season, The Columbia Orchestra is clearly matching its reputation as one of Howard Magazine\u2019s \u201c51 Things We Love About Living In Howard County.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>",

That the first performance could barely be heard over the background noise in the Mehlgrube Casino probably contributed to the gloom, as did the fact that Mozart had barely finished it when he took his seat at the piano. The premiere was, in fact, a scramble. As his father wrote to Mozart\u2019s sister Nannerl:\r\n</a></font></p><ul>\r\n<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\"><a name=\"wm\">I heard an excellent new piano concerto by Wolfgang, on which the copyist was still at work when we got there, and your brother didn't even have time to play through the rondo because he had to oversee the copying operation. \r\n</a></font></ul>\r\n<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\"><a name=\"wm\">Mozart conducted frantically from the keyboard, nodding occasionally to the terrified concertmaster, whose suspicion that the only full score was still in Mozart\u00b4s head was entirely justified. There would be similar scenes nearly 150 years later, as George Gershwin nodded to Paul Whiteman to tell him the (improvised!) piano solo sections were about to end during the first performance of <i>Rhapsody in Blue.</i> Mozart\u2019s audience consisted of what his obsessively class-conscious father called \u201ca vast concourse of people of rank,\u201d hovering between his son\u2019s music and the gaming tables. Only the previous evening, Joseph Haydn had told Leopold that Wolfgang was \u201cthe greatest composer known to me, either personally or be reputation,\u201d yet here he was now, struggling for attention.\r\n</a></font><p>\r\n<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\"><a name=\"wm\">A month earlier, the Mehlgrube\u2019s star attraction had been the blind pianist Maria Theresia von Paradis (for whom Mozart wrote a concerto); the month before, there had been a conjurer. As always, the composer\u2019s social standing teetered between very shaky popular adulation and the wow-but-so-what feeling that now (briefly) meets the denizens of <i>American Idol.</i> This hovering between the worlds of the courtly flunky and popular stardom (no problem at all for musicians only fifty years later) was an important factor in his ultimate impoverishment and early death. It\u2019s therefore all the more surprising that Mozart chose an occasion like this to launch one of his darkest, most searching works.\r\n</a></font></p><p>\r\n<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\"><a name=\"wm\">The first movement opens with\u2014no, not the first subject of the inevitable sonata form opener. Instead, we hear motifs\u2014fragments that together <i>add up</i> to thematic material, an astonishing foreshadowing of the gigantic mosaics of Wagner, set over nagging, syncopated string chords. Instead of the usual setting out of the structural shop that we expect at the opening of a Classical concerto, we instead are offered what can only be called mood-setting. It is only when the piano enters that our old friends A and B become clearly audible. There would be nothing like this again until the concertos of Beethoven, who revered this work and played it in public several times. Indeed, it is Beethoven\u2019s cadenzas that we are hearing this evening in the first and last movements.\r\n</a></font></p><p>\r\n<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\"><a name=\"wm\">Like Beethoven after him, Mozart often carried out his more outrageous formal experiments in his slow movements, and this concerto has a vivid example in its rondo structure\u2014easily the least likely form to be expected here (not least because this movement is followed by another one). Even less likely is the dramatic lurch into G minor towards the end. Beethoven would often challenge himself (and us) with sudden plunges into distant keys, as though daring himself to find a way home; he may well have been inspired by Mozart\u2019s leap into the tonal darkness here. Always civilized and precise, of course (it\u2019s Mozart, after all), but with the faintest cracks and shadows in the porcelain. Nor should we forget that Mozart reserved his darkest thoughts (think of the fortieth symphony) for the key of G minor.\r\n</a></font></p><p>\r\n<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\"><a name=\"wm\">The Finale is the rondo we might expect\u2014but, once again, G minor lurks in the tonal forest. It is not hard to believe that Mozart looked at that Casino audience and saw, not the career-saving Fairy Godfather that his father saw that day, but the Wolf. The concerto\u2019s optimistic D major ending barely dissipates the darkness. Only seven years later, Mozart would be in an unmarked grave barely ten blocks from the Casino.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</a><a name=\"gm\">\r\n</a></font></p><p><font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\"><a name=\"gm\"><br>\r\n<b><font size=\"3\">GUSTAV MAHLER (1860\u20131911)</font>\r\n</b></a></font></p><p>\r\n<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\"><a name=\"gm\"><b>SYMPHONY No. 1 in D<br>\r\n</b>\r\nCOMPOSED: 1884\u201388<br>\r\nPREMIERED: Budapest, Hungary, 1889<br>\r\n</a></font></p><p>\r\n<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\"><a name=\"gm\">No, not the <i>Titan.</i> Mahler ditched the subtitle early in this work\u2019s tortuous early history (read on!). His wife, the later much-married Alma, could never bear listening to the First Symphony, because she knew what it was about; few wives (and certainly not one as independent of spirit as Alma) wish to wallow in the murky history of their husband\u2019s love lives. \r\n</a></font></p><p>\r\n<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\"><a name=\"gm\">The Symphony began as music inspired by the soprano Johanna Richter, with whom Mahler had an absurdly one-sided non-affair in 1884. This object lesson in unrequited love resulted firstly in the doom-laden <i>Songs of a Wayfarer.</i> One of these, the deceptively chirpy <i>Ging heut\u2019 Morgen,</i> is tested to destruction in the first movement of the Symphony. Johanna claimed, absurdly, to be related to Mahler\u2019s favorite author, Jean-Paul Richter. Jean-Paul\u2019s most popular novel, <i>Titan,</i> rarely left Mahler\u2019s bedside. The book\u2019s intimidating structure\u201435 chapters and 146 sub-chapters\u2014has been cited as an arguable origin for Mahler\u2019s later symphonic giantism, but rather more to the point is Jean-Paul\u2019s concept of the <i>hoher Mensch,</i> the \u201csuperior man\u201d that would eventually morph, at least for Mahler, into the Nietzschean <i>\u00dcbermensch.</i> The fact that Jean-Paul tells his tale in the form of a gargantuan, overwrought fairy-tale very nearly gives us Mahler\u2019s musical thinking in a nutshell.\r\n</a></font></p><p>\r\n<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\"><a name=\"gm\">After Fr\u00e4ulein Richter ditched him, Mahler embarked on a guilt-ridden liaison with Marion Weber, the wife of Carl Maria von Weber\u2019s grandson, made all the worse by the fact that her husband was trusting him with editing the musical heritage of his grandfather, who was one of Mahler\u2019s heroes. Mahler was not Wagner, and, unlike the Sage of Bayreuth, had a conscience; the halting, fumbling, emotionally frantic result suggests what might have happened happen if Schiller edited <i>Peyton Place;</i> the musical spin-off was Mahler\u2019s incidental music for Joseph Victor von Scheffel\u2019s play <i>Der Trompeter von S\u00e4ckingen.</i> This music also found its way into the Symphony, only to be thrown out again. Like Mahler himself, one might say.\r\n</a></font></p><p>\r\n<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\"><a name=\"gm\">Symphony? Not originally. Mahler launched the work as a <i>\u201cTitan,</i> a Symphonic Poem in Two Parts.\u201d Following Jean-Paul\u2019s baleful example, Mahler subdivided the two parts into three and two movements respectively. The second movement, <i>Blumine,</i> was the recycled <i>Trompeter von S\u00e4ckingen</i> music; traumatic events with Marion Weber house resulted in Mahler scrapping the movement after its second performance, in 1894. It would lie forgotten until resurrected by (curiously) Benjamin Britten in 1967. Not entirely helpfully, Mahler supplied the audience with detailed program notes linking the music to Jean-Paul\u2019s epic; an unappreciative Budapest audience laughed the work off the stage. Mahler admitted at the time that he had made up the programmatic content <i>after</i> writing the music. An old story in the ever-deceptive emotional world of Romanticism.\r\n</a></font></p><p>\r\n<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\"><a name=\"gm\">It was only in 1896 that the Symphony finally appeared in its present form, minus <i>Blumine</i> and without its title. It was now the Symphony in D for Large Orchestra, and so it remains today. Ironically, the Berlin critics slammed the work for its <i>lack</i> of programmatic content.\r\n</a></font></p><p>\r\n<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\"><a name=\"gm\">This apparent indecision points to the very heart of Mahler\u2019s music. The Funeral March of Beethoven\u2019s <i>Eroica</i> symphony evokes\u2014in advance\u2014the departed Napoleon; Mahler\u2019s Funeral March is a mangled <i>Fr\u00e8re Jacques,</i> and suggests the obsequies for an unfortunate puppet. This sort of irony was always going to cause Mahler problems with an audience that liked its emotions untainted; indeed, it would be the 1960s before his music achieved the popularity it deserved. Two World Wars, grimly foreseen by Nietzsche, had made the old Romanticism not merely impossible but unbearable.\r\n</a></font></p><p>\r\n<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\"><a name=\"gm\">The first movement, based largely on the song <i>Ging heut\u2019 Morgen</i> (not so much inspired as <i>caused</i> by Johanna Richter), emerges from a drastic re-hearing of the opening of Beethoven\u2019s Ninth, as distant fanfares and tweeting birds usher us into Mahler\u2019s world. A symphony, he would tell Jean Sibelius, must be a world, and this is his. The <i>Wayfarer</i> song is heralded by the unmistakable sound of the cuckoo. Unmistakable, but nonstandard: Austrian cuckoos, it seems, sing a fourth, rather than the traditional third.\r\n</a></font></p><p>\r\n<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\"><a name=\"gm\">One of Mahler\u2019s early songs, <i>Hans und Grete</i> (another love song - inspiration, mercifully, unknown) is recycled in the second movement into a vision of precisely the pan-Germanic merriment that Mahler never felt at home in. Like the peasant dance in Bart\u00f3k\u2019s Concerto for Orchestra\u2014once described as \u201ca man trying to dance with a foot nailed to the floor\u201d\u2014this is music expressing almost exactly the opposite of what it seems to be. This is the music of the outsider, who always hears from afar, even when surrounded by the musicians.\r\n</a></font></p><p>\r\n<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\"><a name=\"gm\">Mahler knew <i>Fr\u00e8re Jacques</i> as <i>Bruder Martin.</i> Early audiences were violently offended by its transformation into a dirge in the third movement, as though it were an affront to the very thought of childish innocence. Which is exactly what it is. Mahler is at his grimmest precisely when he is joking. A lifelong admirer of Nietzsche, he was well acquainted with the philosopher\u2019s motto\u2014<i>Ridendo dicere severum;</i> saying stern things with a smile. Mahler claimed that the music was inspired by a woodcut called <i>The Hunter\u2019s Funeral Procession</i>\u2014which may even be true. But anyone who has been through the emotional mill of Stephen Sondheim\u2019s <i>Into The Woods</i> knows what can happen to childish materials in the hands of a master. And so it is here.\r\n</a></font></p><p>\r\n<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\"><a name=\"gm\">Mahler\u2019s own early program note calls the last movement of the symphony \u201cThe cry of a wounded heart\u201d\u2014his, of course. The movement acts as the apotheosis of the early movements\u2014the goal they never reached. The Wayfarer of the first movement finally reaches his destination (it is almost a surprise that he had one); even poor Marion Weber makes an appearance as the <i>Blumine</i> music drifts achingly by\u2014referring back, ironically, to music that Mahler had cut. The music, all too obviously, is conjuring up an ecstasy that he never knew in the \u201creal\u201d world (is there one?); the blaze of brass (seven horns!) that closes the work is an invitation into the Beyond.\r\n<op>\r\nJean-Paul once said, in a phrase that would echo eternally in Nietzsche, \u201cJoy, unlike seriousness, is inexhaustible.\u201d Mahler clearly knew what he meant; he had learned the hard way. Through his music, we can learn the same lesson. \r\n",
