      "bio": "<p>After a disastrous attempt at learning piano at age 4 which ended in tears, my father said to me at age 7, \"Pick an instrument.\" I remember watching Sesame Street at the time and Sarah Chang was playing her little prodigy heart out during a commercial break. I thought, she's my age and it looks easy. Avoiding another argument about my then proven musical inability, I responded, \"Violin.\" The very next day with my rented 1/4 size violin, I arrived at Settlement Music School in Jenkintown, PA, a suburb of Philadelphia. \r\n\r\nAfter a few years of being relegated to the garage behind soundproof walls, my squeaky bowings eventually turned into palatable musical tones. Still, I hated individual recitals and nearly gave up playing because of my petrifying stage fright as a soloist. Thankfully, I learned to love the violin when I joined my first chamber group and discovered the beauty in group melodies. Two years later, I joined my first orchestra.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since then, I continued playing throughout high school and at the University of Pennsylvania in various orchestral and chamber groups. I was lucky enough to receive instruction by Ghislaine Fleshman, a member of the Philadelphia Orchestra. After college, I played in the Mainline Symphony Orchestra before moving from Philadelphia to the Columbia area and joined the Columbia Orchestra in 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am grateful for the opportunities a musical education provided me and believe music was a key factor in keeping me from falling into the pitfalls of an urban environment as an adolescent.</p>",

John, a Pennsylvania native, was introduced to the cello as a junior-high student by Donald E. Sutter who was the lead violinist for a string quartet in which John took part at Trinity Lutheran Church in Coatesville, PA.  John, originally a trumpeter, switched to the French horn and held the first chair horn position in the Coatesville Area Senior High School Symphonic Band.  As the first chair cellist in the Coatesville Area Senior High Orchestra, John placed to sit third chair at the Mid-East All Star Orchestra during his junior year, and played the Grieg Piano Concerto and the Great Gate of Kiev from Mussorgsky\u2019s Pictures at an Exhibition at the festival concert.  He attended the string workshops at West Chester University each summer as a teenager.  John studied Psychology at Waynesburg University, Waynesburg, Pennsylvania and graduated in 1973 with a Bachelor\u2019s Degree.  At Waynesburg, he was a member of the fledgling Waynesburg Marching Band and its orchestra under the direction of Allen C Emerick.  John attended graduate school at Roosevelt University in Chicago, Illinois where he earned a Master\u2019s Degree in Public Administration and played with the Chatham Symphony, the DePaul University Orchestra (Leon Stein) and the Lewis University Orchestra.  John continues to enjoy playing chamber music, and is a volunteer musician at St Mark\u2019s Evangelical Lutheran Church in Baltimore where he is a member.  One of John\u2019s favorite remembrances is of a comment made by his father, Lee, during  intermission at a Mid-East orchestra performance in Schwenksville, PA that featured the Beethoven 1st Symphony:  \u2018Man, I thought that song would never end!\u2019 quipped his Dad.

My first child was born after the end of our first season together. This is a place where I can come make music with others, where we can become one unit as we work together to perform a particular piece of music. Through my own personal life journey the orchestra has been part of who I am. I am grateful for the opportunity to continue playing French Horn over the long haul. It is an honor and a privilege to be a part of these fine musicians. I am a graduate of Gettysburg College and Wesley Theological Seminary. On Monday nights, I belong to the orchestra, the rest of the time I am a Mom of two wonderful college age young women and a pastor at Taylorsville United Methodist Church. I am grateful to God for the gift of music, and as for me, I pray that all the music that I am a part of gives glory to God my Savior.</p>",

I started playing the violin in the summer between third and fourth grade.  I\u2019ve played in orchestras ever since, all through junior and senior high school, college (Purdue), and since the first year of the Columbia Orchestra\u2019s existence.  Being able to touch the music first-hand gives me an increased appreciation of the music, and being enveloped by the music provides a thrill that cannot be realized by simply listening through speakers or (heaven forbid) earbuds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I enjoy all types of classical music, but my real joy is music of the 20th (and now 21st) Century, especially the Russians (Shostakovich, Schnittke), Americans (Corigliano, Rouse, Glass), and Scandinavians (Sibelius, Nielsen, Sallinen).  I also occasionally listen to so-called popular music (Joe Jackson, Pat Metheny, and yes, the Beatles), but I return to classical music because the complexity holds my interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My day job involves way too many hours each week doing program management at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab.  When not working or playing/listening to music, I watch movies (Blood Simple, 12 Monkeys, Apocalypse Now, and more recently Up in the Air).  My wife (of 33 years) and I also like to hike (we just spent a long weekend at Shenandoah National Park) and watch TV (Modern Family, Better off Ted, The Good Wife).  In addition, as president of the Columbia Orchestra and Chairman of the Finance Committee, I spend time on orchestra-related administrative activities.  And every so often, we visit with our daughter Valerie, who is trying to succeed as a freelance cellist playing classical, popular, experimental music on the New York Scene.</p>",

Besides Columbia, I play with the Howard County Ballet Orchestra, the Ellicott Brass, and the Barleycorn Brass Quintet  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Who else in your family is a musicians?  Although my older brother is a college philosophy professor, he also composes music and fools around on the fiddle and the saxophone. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where did you go to school and what did you study?   I got my undergraduate degree in American history at Brown University and I went to law school at the University of Pennsylvania</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With whom have you studied?  I have studied in recent years with Dave Fedderly, tuba player with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra.   </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Favorite Columbia Orchestra concert and why? Three: (1) Playing \u201cTubby the Tuba\u201d at the Children\u2019s Concert in December 2005 (what can I say, I loved being a soloist in front of enthusiastic children); (2) Playing Stravinsky\u2019s \u201cRite of Spring\u201d in October 20009 (Rite of Spring was one of the first pieces of classical music I discovered as a child and it had been a dream of mine to play it someday); and (3) Playing Mahler\u2019s Symphony No. 1 in May 2010 (another dream of mine).  Runner up:  My first concert with the Columbia Orchestra in October 1996.  I hadn\u2019t played in an orchestra or band in 15 years and the return of musical performance to my life was an amazing gift.  It also didn\u2019t hurt that I met my wife going into the dress rehearsal for that concert. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>What are your favorite composers or pieces?  Very hard to pare it down:  Ralph Vaughan Williams, Aaron Copland, Walter Piston, Paul Hindemith, William Schuman, William Walton, Bach, Handel, Stravinsky, Mahler, Strauss, Dvorak, Elgar, John Adams, the list goes on & on.  Particular pieces: Stravinsky, Rite of Spring & Agon; Bartok, Concerto for Orchestra; William Schuman, Symphony No. 3; Lutoslawski, Concerto for Orchestra; Hindemith, Symphonic Metamorphosis; Vaughan Williams, Pastoral Symphony and Symphony No. 5; William Walton, Symphony No. 1 ... </p>\r\n\r\n<p>What\u2019s on your iPod?  All of the above, plus lots of jazz, plus eclectic \u201870 & 80's folks & rock (Tom Petty, Bruce Hornsby, Fleetwood Mac, Eagles, James Taylor, etc) </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last book you read? \u201cAmerican Heroes\u201d by Edmund Morgan & \u201cThe First Rule\u201d by Robert Crais </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Favorite TV shows?  \u201cFriday Night Lights\u201d </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other surprising facts about you?  I was born in North Dakota.  I\u2019m married to Lynn Halverson, a former cello player in the orchestra (see dress rehearsal story above).  We collect many, many books, especially cookbooks.  I also collect an insane number of CDs.  I was a park ranger at Natural Bridges National Monument, Utah in 1976, the summer after my freshman year in college.  I was a trial lawyer in Philadelphia before moving to the D.C. area in 1989 (in another life...)   </p>",

      "bio": "<p>Columbia Orchestra Member for Decades (can\u2019t remember when I started) </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I began with piano at some single digit age, but piano was never my main instrument.  I tried trumpet in 6th grade, but switched to trombone in 7th and dropped it junior year due to a school change (no instrumental music at the new school). </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I trained for a career in Electrical Engineering at the University of Bridgeport (Connecticut), and worked in that field and project management for just over 30 years, retiring early.  After about 7 years of retirement, I started a home improvement business which I still own and operate.  (I am really the only employee.) </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also trained as a pilot, holding a commercial license, with single-engine land and sea, multi-engine land, and instrument ratings.  While I owned a small plane back then, I am inactive in that field now.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>In the late 1970\u2019s, I joined the Columbia Concert Band playing trombone after a 22 year hiatus, then moved to a jazz big band course at UMBC, then joined the Columbia Big Band (CBB).  In the early 1980\u2019s I co-produced a Big Band jazz show at Ethel\u2019s Place (which featured renowned jazz singer Ethel Ennis), Ethel\u2019s Place being a new jazz club in Baltimore directly across the street from the Meyerhoff Theater.  Playing in that show was probably the greatest musical high of my life, certainly at that time, anyway.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>I never really lost interest in piano though, and in the early 1980\u2019s received some piano lessons from Marc Cohen (now Marc Copeland), who is a pretty well known jazz pianist.  He had a remarkably different approach to teaching piano which I have never forgotten.  I would be happy to talk about it sometime.  After those lessons, I played much more piano than ever before, and I still play often, mostly just improv and mostly at home. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the early 1990\u2019s I joined the Columbia Jazz Band (CJB) (not to be confused with the Columbia Big Band (CBB)), but this time on bass guitar.  I had never played the bass guitar before, so I had to learn it really quickly.  At present, I am still in that position.  That band is currently under the direction of Pete Barrenbregge, former director of the Airmen of Note, the Air Force\u2019s premier jazz band.  In 2008, I toured Europe with the CJB, playing in the Montreux (Switzerland) Jazz Festival, and three other locations in Europe.  More Europe touring is in the works.  We have also played at Blues Alley, Washington, DC\u2019s top jazz supper club. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don\u2019t remember when I joined the Columbia Orchestra, but I know it was in the previous century.  I play 2nd trombone there.  I have no training in classical music, so every season is a new adventure. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also play in a trombone choir which is (usually) 12 trombones, playing under the direction of David Fetter, a former Principal Trombone in the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are in the market for any home improvements, please check my ad in the Orchestra Programs.</p>",

Mom plays the piano and encouraged me to take up the bass so we could have a family band. My brother was the drummer, my sister played the marimba, and I learned how to pluck the bass strings. I played in the high school orchestra and was part of several small jazz groups during that time (we called ourselves The Marlboros because we were so cool). I played for one year in the Annapolis Symphony when it was a community orchestra in the early 1960s. In college, I played for several years until protesting the Vietnam War took up most of my time. After college, I lived with some \u2018friends\u2019 on a ranch in Colorado; I managed to learn a few notes on the tuba so I could play in the local fire department band. I also played the bass in a few gigs with a small group at a local bar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many years passed when the bass was just another piece of furniture.

She collects degrees in music in her spare time and has a masters in Music Composition (\u201910) and Education (\u201910) from the Peabody Conservatory of Johns Hopkins University. She holds three undergraduate music degrees in Bassoon Performance, Music Education, and Composition with a minor in Jazz Voice from also from Peabody. In 2010 she will embark on a PhD program in Music Theory with a minor in bassoon performance at the Catholic University of America.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Monica teaches private bassoon lessons and regularly freelances with local orchestras. She also enjoys performing chamber music and meets regularly with the Columbia Chamber Winds and her bassoon quartet. She has studied bassoon with Linda Harwell (retired National Symphony) as an undergraduate, Terry Ewell (Towson University), Truman Harris (National Symphony), and Barrick Stees (Cleveland Orchestra, Interlochen).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also an accomplished composer, her works have been featured locally and as far as several places in England. Her chamber opera, Wings of Fire, was produced by the Peabody Opera Department.  Also she was awarded several grants, including a Johns Hopkins Provost grant to present a recital of new works for bassoon at the International Double Reed Society Convention in Tempe, Arizona.  In 2008 she presented a complete recital of her works featuring a full chorus, wind quintet, bass voice, and harp works at Peabody.  She has studied composition with Thomas Benjamin, Nicolas Maw, Moris Cotel, and Mark Lanz Weiser.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Monica has been a band director in Howard County Public Schools since 2001 and has been twice nominated for \u2018Music Teacher of the Year for Howard County.\u2019  Monica is a member of the American Composers Forum, MMEA, and MENC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Monica spends a lot time playing bassoon, teaching, and composing--but she also takes time to enjoy the other finer things in life.   She plays on a Howard County Rec & Parks adult soccer team weekly and has played soccer almost every year of her life since before she can remember. She is also Chelsea Football Club (English Premier League) fan and can't wait to cheer on the US in the World Cup.  She also counts oil painting, calligraphy, and origami among her hobbies which she loves to do herself, or visit art galleries to see, or take classes in, or lessons from masters to learn more about these art forms.  She thinks she would have been a visual artist if she had not become a musician.  She loves to travel and thinks Iceland and the Ice Hotel in Canada are the coolest places she's ever been (no pun intended).  She also loves walking her two crazy pugs-- Dizzy (Gillespie) and Miles (Davis) who are very competitive and always try to out do each other with how silly they can be.</p>",

I love playing this instrument because violists are usually a down-to-earth, laid-back group and the music written for the viola is unique and interesting.  I will definitely never forget the string quartet I gigged with in high school.  We played in beautiful, old churches, malls, and even in the frozen food section of a grocery store (with a guy dressed up as a chicken conducting)!</p>\r\n \r\n<p>As a child my parents encouraged my love of classical music.  My sister (she played the violin) and I listened to cassette tapes of composer biographies on family vacations and we even had a memory card game with composers and their most well-known pieces!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My favorite composer is Antonin Dvorak because he played the viola, and he wrote music inspired by the common man of his home country.  My favorite symphony is Tchaikovsky's Pathetique Symphony #6.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I cherish Monday nights with the Columbia Orchestra.

Ok, that's not exactly true, I play the cello and it is by far my favorite instrument.  No offense to Saint-Sa\u00ebns' Act 3 Scene 2, I still love you oboe!  Must be something about the O's.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In elementary school, the music teacher came in and demonstrated all of the string instruments to the class. I heard the cello and went home to tell my parents I wanted to play that night.  This is from a person indecisive enough to take years before deciding to play baseball as a kid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I've got Rostropovich's autograph stashed away somewhere, own the scores to Prokofiev 2, 4, 5, and 6, a rare English biography of Miaskovsky, and a book of Alfred Brendel's poetry.  My parents met singing Beethoven 9, and my dad once had lunch with Messaien.  (Though my grandfather once had a steak with Ted Williams.)  I like everything about music except Lalo and Yo-Yo, so it must again be something about the O's.

Big props to my old quartet (Peggy, Mollie & Ariel!), my cello friends (Kacy, Kristen), my music friends [yes, IN order!] (Andrea, Ashleigh, Cameo, Celia, Enoch, Jerome, Robin [the oldest], and Val [the newest]), my orchestras, GBYO & UMD, and Jason, my sisters, and... everyone else I missed and cause trouble with!</p>",

      "bio": "<p>I began playing the viola in 1968 and continued through High School.  I lived on Long Island at the time in an area with outstanding public school music programs.  My HS orchestra had several students studying at Julliard prep, and we were a pretty hot orchestra.  I only took the free 30 minute/once a week lessons offered in school, and the game was to get the music director so busy talking about other interests that we blew through the lesson without having to play!  So here I am today, still playing.  I guess the lack of pressure allowed me to enjoy playing, so I've continued on, just learning as I went.  Not one private lesson ever...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joined the Columbia Orchestra in 1986 when the group was still rehearsing in Yong Ku Ahn's basement.  I hadn't been playing for over 8 years by this point, so when I showed up at the first rehearsal I just slipped into the last seat in the section and hoped for the best.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I love the challenge of playing in a group.  You try to deliver what the conductor is asking for.  This takes great peripheral vision, and the ability to read body language as well as squints, threatening brows and the dreaded finger point.  To work with up to 80 other people trying to become \"one\" for an extended period of time takes incredible concentration and listening skills.  I often cannot sleep for hours after intense rehearsals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of my off time is spent racing our sailboat out of Annapolis.  Last year we logged more than 500 miles under her keel in one race season!  I serve on several other organizations' boards of directors, and was the Columbia Orchestra Treasurer when we voted to move from a chamber group to Full Symphony.  I am so thankful for the opportunity to play with this caliber of musicians, and of course our outstanding Music Director, Jason Love.</p>",
